# [The Flix Programming Language](flix.github.io)

<h3>A functional and logic programming language inspired by Scala, OCaml, and Datalog</h3>


Flix is a statically typed functional- and logic programming language inspired by Scala, OCaml, F#, Haskell, and Datalog. The syntax of Flix resembles Scala and Datalog. The type system supports local type inference and is based on Hindley-Milner. Flix runs on the Java Virtual Machine and compiles directly to JVM bytecode.

Flix supports hybrid functional and logic programming featuring a built-in fixed point engine based on semi-naive evaluation. The functional and logic languages can be used independently, if so desired. For example, a Flix program can be purely functional, or Flix can be used as a standalone Datalog engine.
